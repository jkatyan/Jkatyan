### Hey there, I'm Jay!

I'm a software engineer and researcher passionate about people, startups, and artificial intelligence.

---

I'm actively researching embodied intelligence, multimodal knowledge retrieval, agentic memory systems, and continual learning at the University of Pennsylvania's <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/">GRASP Lab</a>. As an undergraduate, I researched language model–assisted code generation at the <a href="https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/">Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics</a>, and developed sparse-sensor pose estimation methods at the <a href="https://www.assistiveroboticslab.com/home">Assistive Robotics Lab</a>. I also spent some time working on computer vision techniques for monocular dense reconstruction at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a>.

I'm a huge hackathon enthusiast (and former hackathon director!), and several of my projects are available on <a href="https://devpost.com/jkatyan">Devpost</a>. Most recently, I won the "Most Technically Complex/Challenging Hack" award at UC Berkeley for developing [Haven](https://devpost.com/software/haven-cs0lzq), an agentic assistant for anxiety attack detection and intervention (real-time voice agents, language models, and procedurally generated voice-to-3D environments!) Earlier this year, I also won "Best Overall" at Virginia Tech for developing [SafeSound](https://devpost.com/software/safesound-4atsrn), a multithreaded, real-time "transparency mode" for headphones to filter trigger words for PTSD patients.

Beyond hackathons, I actively experiment with language models, program robots, and automate absolutely everything.
